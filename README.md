# Online Library Search


## Description
This python script searches a title and/or author on all the user's available online book resources - Overdrive, Hoopla, library catalogue, etc. 


## How it works
In terminal, run `python search.py`

The command line prompt will welcome you and give instructions on how to use it. Enter your search when prompted.

You will have the option to search your preferred websites all at once or one at a time (so if you find what you are looking for you can end the search).


## Bye
Happy reading!
